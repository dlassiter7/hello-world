Getting started

Hello world.

I am Dax. I am beginning my journey of self taught coding. Currently I work full time in a retail enviroment. It's time to change that and follow my passion.

Ever since I was little, I have been messing with computers in one way or another. Whether that be hardware, software, the internet, etc. I have always loved them. However, I do not love school. Because of this, I did not follow my passion and did not break into the tech scene.

Fast forward 14 years and here we are. A journey that I hope has a great ending!
